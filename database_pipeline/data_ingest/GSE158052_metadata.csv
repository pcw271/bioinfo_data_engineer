!Series_summary	"RNA structure heterogeneity is a major challenge when querying RNA structures with chemical probing. We introduce DRACO, an algorithm for the deconvolution of coexisting RNA conformations from mutational profiling experiments."
!Series_summary	"Analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 genome using dimethyl sulfate mutational profiling with sequencing (DMS-MaPseq) and DRACO, identifies multiple regions that fold into two mutually exclusive conformations, including a conserved structural switch in the 3′ untranslated region. This work may open the way to dissecting the heterogeneity of the RNA structurome."

Subsequently, 1 μl of 500 mM MgCl2 (pre-warmed at 37°C) was added and RNA was further incubated for 20 min at 37°C to allow tertiary structure formation. For probing of RNA, DMS was pre-diluted 1:6 in 100% ethanol and added to a final concentration of 150 mM. Samples were then incubated at 37°C for 2 min.

DRACO was invoked with default parameters. Following DRACO analysis, windows in which the median coverage (calculated on reads passing DRACO’s filtering) was above 5,000X were selected. To select windows coherently folding into multiple conformations in both replicates, we retained windows predicted to have the same number of conformations in two replicates, overlapping by at least 75% of their length, and considered only their intersection.
